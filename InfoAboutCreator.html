      About The Creator

  <h2 style="color:#f1f1f1">
This is the page about the creator, 
I know I should probably tell you about myself aswell as some useless and pointless information.
But theres no point in really telling you what to do. 
Beacuse I have the feeling that you'll just do it anyway.
Information about me won't really help you,
so this page is really just tips, a couple that I wish I knew earlier.
<li>Spend money on cosmetics before upgrading(drip is key)</li>
<li>Light spam if you suck.</li>
<li>Double teaming is ok.</li>
You might be wondering why I disguised my tips page as a info page about the creator.
Well it's simple, because I can.
Here's my person that I learned from and how to play from.
